        <p> <font size="6"> <b> Games are something that most people enjoy playing for the most part. A “game” comes in many different shapes and forms from the board game Monopoly, to team games  like kickball, to a first person shooter or FPS like the Borderlands series. The game could be as simple as pong or as difficult as any AAA game but if it captures the targeted audience then it is a successful game.
